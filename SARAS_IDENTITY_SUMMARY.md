# SARAS Identity Implementation Summary

## Changes Made to Enable AI Identity as "SARAS"

### 1. Updated AI Configuration (`src/ieee_epic/core/config.py`)

**Modified the `system_instruction` in the `AISettings` class:**

**Before:**
```python
system_instruction: str = Field(
    default=(
        "You are a friendly teacher for lower/primary school students. "
        "Answer in a simple, age-appropriate way with short sentences. "
        "Use easy words and clear examples. If the child speaks Malayalam, reply in Malayalam; "
        "if they speak English, reply in English. Be kind, encouraging, and brief."
    ),
    description="System instruction for the AI model"
)
```

**After:**
```python
system_instruction: str = Field(
    default=(
        "You are SARAS, a friendly teacher for lower/primary school students. "
        "When asked about your name or who you are, always respond that your name is SARAS. "
        "Answer in a simple, age-appropriate way with short sentences. "
        "Use easy words and clear examples. If the child speaks Malayalam, reply in Malayalam; "
        "if they speak English, reply in English. Be kind, encouraging, and brief."
    ),
    description="System instruction for the AI model"
)
```

### 2. Updated Greeting Messages (`simple_handshake_ai.py`)

**Modified the `get_greeting()` method to introduce SARAS:**

**Before:**
```python
greetings = [
    "Hello! I saw your wave. How can I help you today?",
    "Hi there! Your handshake got my attention. What's on your mind?",
    "Greetings! I'm here to assist. What would you like to talk about?",
    "Hello! Thanks for the wave. How are you doing today?",
    "Hi! I detected your handshake. What can I do for you?"
]
```

**After:**
```python
greetings = [
    "Hello! I'm SARAS. I saw your wave. How can I help you today?",
    "Hi there! I'm SARAS, your assistant. Your handshake got my attention. What's on your mind?",
    "Greetings! I'm SARAS, and I'm here to assist. What would you like to talk about?",
    "Hello! I'm SARAS. Thanks for the wave. How are you doing today?",
    "Hi! I'm SARAS. I detected your handshake. What can I do for you?"
]
```

### 3. Updated Farewell Messages (`simple_handshake_ai.py`)

**Modified the `get_farewell()` method to mention SARAS:**

**Before:**
```python
farewells = [
    "Goodbye! Wave again anytime you want to chat.",
    "See you later! I'll be here when you need me.",
    "Take care! Just wave to start another conversation.",
    "Bye for now! Looking forward to our next chat.",
    "Farewell! I'm always ready for another handshake."
]
```

**After:**
```python
farewells = [
    "Goodbye! This is SARAS. Wave again anytime you want to chat.",
    "See you later! SARAS will be here when you need me.",
    "Take care! Just wave to start another conversation with SARAS.",
    "Bye for now! SARAS is looking forward to our next chat.",
    "Farewell! I'm SARAS, and I'm always ready for another handshake."
]
```

### 4. Created Test Scripts

**Created `test_saras_identity.py`:**
- Tests various identity questions in both English and Malayalam
- Verifies that the AI responds with "SARAS" when asked about its name

**Created `test_greetings.py`:**
- Tests the updated greeting and farewell messages
- Verifies that SARAS is mentioned in initial interactions

## Test Results

✅ **Identity Questions Test:**
- "What is your name?" → "Hello! My name is SARAS..."
- "Who are you?" → "I am SARAS. I am like a helpful teacher..."
- "നിന്റെ പേര് എന്താണ്?" → "എന്റെ പേര് SARAS എന്നാണ്..."

✅ **Bilingual Support:**
- AI responds in Malayalam when asked Malayalam questions
- AI responds in English when asked English questions
- SARAS identity is maintained in both languages

## How It Works

1. **System Instruction:** The core AI behavior is defined in the configuration file. The Gemini API uses this instruction to understand how to behave and respond.

2. **Greeting Integration:** When users first interact via handshake, they immediately hear the SARAS introduction.

3. **Conversational Identity:** During any conversation, when users ask about the AI's name or identity, it will consistently respond as SARAS.

4. **Multilingual Identity:** The identity works in both English and Malayalam, maintaining cultural and linguistic appropriateness.

## Usage

Now when you interact with the AI system:
- **Handshake greeting:** "Hello! I'm SARAS. I saw your wave..."
- **Name questions:** "What's your name?" → "My name is SARAS"
- **Identity questions:** "Who are you?" → "I am SARAS, a friendly teacher..."
- **Malayalam queries:** "നിന്റെ പേര് എന്താണ്?" → "എന്റെ പേര് SARAS എന്നാണ്"

The AI will now consistently identify itself as SARAS across all interactions!
