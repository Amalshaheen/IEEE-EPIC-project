        audio = self.listen_for_speech(timeout=10)
        
        # 2. Language Detection & Recognition
        if language == "auto":
            # Try Malayalam first, then English
            text, lang = self._try_bilingual_recognition(audio)
        else:
            text, lang = self._recognize_single_language(audio, language)
            
        return text, lang
```

**Pipeline Stages:**

        if use_context:
            enhanced_input = self._add_conversation_context(user_input)
        
        # 2. Gemini API Call
        response = self.gemini_generator.generate_response(
            enhanced_input,
            max_tokens=self.settings.ai.max_tokens,
            temperature=self.settings.ai.temperature
        )
        
        # 3. Response Post-processing
        final_response = self._process_response(response)
        
        # 4. Update Conversation History
        self.conversation.add_interaction(user_input, final_response)
        
        return final_response
```
