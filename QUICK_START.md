# 🎤 Quick Start Guide - AI Voice Recognition

## 🚀 **You're almost ready!** Your USB microphone is working!

### **Step 1: Set up Google API Key (Required for AI)**

```bash
# Get your API key from: https://console.cloud.google.com/
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Or run the setup script:
./setup_config.sh
```

### **Step 2: Install missing packages (if needed)**

```bash
pip install google-genai
```

### **Step 3: Run the AI Voice Assistant**

```bash
# Enhanced version with Context7 AI
python enhanced_voice_recognition.py
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

1. **🎤 You speak** → "How do I use Python lists?"
2. **🧠 AI processes** → Uses Context7 for technical documentation
3. **🗣️ AI responds** → Intelligent answer with examples
4. **🔊 You hear** → AI speaks the response back to you

## 💡 **Try These Sample Questions:**

### **Programming Questions:**
- "How do I create a Python function?"
- "What is React and how do I use it?"
- "Show me Flask examples"
- "How to use NumPy arrays?"

### **General Questions:**
- "What is machine learning?"
- "Explain REST APIs"
- "How does Docker work?"

### **Malayalam Questions:**
- "പൈത്തൺ എന്താണ്?" (What is Python?)
- "റിയാക്റ്റ് എങ്ങനെ ഉപയോഗിക്കാം?" (How to use React?)

## 🎛️ **GUI Features:**

- **🎤 Start Listening**: Begin voice recognition
- **🤖 AI Status**: Check if AI is connected
- **📚 Cache**: View technical documentation cache
- **❓ Help**: Get detailed help
- **🗑️ Clear**: Reset conversation

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

**If AI doesn't work:**
- Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key is valid

**If microphone doesn't work:**
- Your USB mic is already working! 
- But if issues: `alsamixer` → F6 → select USB device → F4 → increase volume

**If TTS doesn't work:**
- Install: `sudo apt-get install mpg123`
- Or try: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`

## 🎉 **What's New:**

✅ **Context7 Enhanced AI**: Gets documentation for technical questions  
✅ **Conversation Memory**: AI remembers context from previous questions  
✅ **Bilingual Support**: English and Malayalam recognition  
✅ **Smart Responses**: No more "You said..." - real AI answers!  
✅ **Technical Support**: Ask about programming, frameworks, libraries  
✅ **Cache System**: Stores documentation for faster responses
